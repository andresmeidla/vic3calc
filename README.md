# Victoria 3 Calculator

Try it out @ [https://vic3calc.com/](https://vic3calc.com/)

The idea behind this project is to automatically calculate resource and building requirements for supply chains in [Victoria 3](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/victoria-3/about).

We use Vue 3 with Typescript for the frontend, and [Jomini](https://github.com/nickbabcock/jomini) to parse the data.

## Run

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then head to the specified address (default is <http://localhost:5173>).

## Future Ideas

Calculate for multiple selected buildings
